# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in PyTorch  
This repository provides a clear, structured, and step‑by‑step implementation of a CNN using PyTorch, with major emphasis on CNN hyperparameters and how they affect model performance.
# What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning model designed specifically for image like data.  
Unlike fully connected networks, CNNs:  
• Exploit spatial structure in images  
• Learn local patterns (edges, textures, shapes)  
• Use shared weights, reducing parameters  
CNNs are widely used in image classification, medical imaging, object detection, and pattern recognition.
